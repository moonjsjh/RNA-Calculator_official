# RNA-Calculator_official
RNA Calculator is a simple tool written in python and Java for android to calculate RNA yield, as well as a set of various measurements. 

## Installation
The calculator will only be distributed as a executable file at the request of each individual. 

## Features
### Input variables
For IVT reaction calculator,
1. T7 RNA polymerase (U)
2. Target RNA transcript size (nt), 
3. DNA vector size (bp)
4. Incubation time (hr)
5. Reaction volume(uL)

For DNA amount calculator,
1. Concentration of DNA template
2. Length of DNA template (bp)
3. Effective concentration (nM)
4. Total reaction volume (uL)

### Output variables
For IVT reaction calculator,
1. Minimum NTP (mM)
2. Estimated maximum RNA yield (ug)
3. Estimated required DNA amount (ug)
4. DNA concentration (nM)
5. Mgcl2(mM)

For DNA amount calculator,
1. DNA Molecular weight
2. Total DNA amount (ug)
3. Required DNA volume (uL)
